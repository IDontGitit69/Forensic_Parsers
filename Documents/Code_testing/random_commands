Weekly Forensic Analyst Report
Week of [insert date]

This week, I conducted analysis on a newly provided forensic image from the customer, which proved to be the most comprehensive piece of evidence obtained during this engagement. During my examination, I identified multiple web shells and a malicious binary on the system.

Upon initial review, I observed that several log files were missing. Based on the evidence, it does not appear that the logs rolled over naturally; rather, they were likely removed intentionally. Leveraging a custom script I developed previously, I extracted data from both the unallocated (free) space and indirect blocks within the image. This process allowed me to successfully recover the deleted log entries and reconstruct portions of system activity that would have otherwise been lost.

As the engagement approaches its conclusion, I also ensured all investigative actions were thoroughly documented and that all identified malware samples were recorded in our master tracking spreadsheet for continuity and reference.

On the deliverable side, the operational tempo of this engagement limited the amount of time available for development work. However, I was able to finalize a YARA validation script, which is now ready to be added to the repository for team review. Looking ahead, I plan to collaborate with another team member next week to implement a synchronization solution that will pull updated rules from [X organization], ensuring our detection signatures remain aligned with the latest threat intelligence developments.
