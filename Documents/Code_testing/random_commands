Weekly Analyst Report

Engineering & Automation

Completed development of a script that ingests detection rule data from our threat intelligence provider and applies relevant metadata to each rule to improve operational usability during engagements.

Implemented logic to track previously ingested rules and prevent duplicate entries from being added to the repository, ensuring data integrity and long-term maintainability.

Finalized CI integration for the ingestion workflow. When triggered via a GitLab runner token, the pipeline automatically executes the rule ingestion process, enabling consistent, repeatable updates with minimal manual intervention.

Incident Response / Targeted Hunt Support

Assisted another analyst on a targeted hunt engagement involving host-based forensic analysis.

Analyzed a provided memory sample and associated artifacts using multiple memory analysis tools to assess the state of a process of interest.

Determined that the process appears to have been running at the time of collection based on corroborating execution artifacts; however, the process contents were not observable in memory.

Assessed that the absence of process memory may be attributable to the memory acquisition methodology used. Due to limited visibility into how the memory was collected, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether the lack of process contents is expected behavior or an artifact of incomplete memory capture.

Findings and limitations were documented and communicated to support accurate interpretation of results.
