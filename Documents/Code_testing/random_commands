Engagement Support

I continued analyzing the artifacts collected from the customer environment. We are currently awaiting one additional system image from the customer—believed to be the host that originally contained the malware discovered on a separate device.

Based on the indicators of compromise (IOCs) identified on the analyzed machine, we assess with high confidence that the second host, for which we only have a logical collection, also contained the same malware.

Obtaining a full image of this second machine will provide an opportunity to validate how the malware was deployed and used across multiple systems. There is a strong possibility that the variant on the second host may have been modified to specifically communicate with the C2 node. A comparative analysis could help answer open questions about the malware’s functionality, operator behavior, and potential lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.

Scripting & Tooling Work

Continued development on the script I’ve been building to streamline artifact processing.

This week, I focused on improving the script’s reliability and expanding its logic to better handle edge cases in the data.

Additional testing was conducted using real-world artifacts from current engagements to validate functionality.

Planned Work for Next Week

Begin deeper analysis if/when the additional system image is received.

Perform comparative malware analysis between the two hosts.

Confirm whether any configuration differences or variant modifications exist.

Document findings related to C2 communication, execution flow, and operator intent.

Continue refining the script, including:

Expanding automation coverage for recurring tasks.

Adding more robust error handling and logging.

Preparing documentation so the script can be used by other analysts.
