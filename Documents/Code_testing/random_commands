Deliverable Project Work – Rule Validation and CI Integration

Progress:

Developed a YARA rule validation script to independently validate and compile rules, ensuring dependencies and imports are properly handled.

Created a rule consolidation script that merges validated rules into a single standardized file for use in tools like THOR.

Implemented an initial CI pipeline that performs linting on consolidated rules to detect syntax errors, duplicates, and compatibility issues with the existing THOR ruleset.

Next Steps:

Integrate the validation script directly into the CI pipeline for automated end-to-end rule compilation and verification.

Identify a persistent GitLab runner solution capable of reliably communicating with the master repository to support consistent CI/CD execution.

Issues / Roadblocks:

Runner availability: Current local runner functions but lacks network accessibility and persistence. A long-term hosting solution is required.

Internal rule sourcing: External rules (e.g., Mandiant, YARA Forge) can be automated, but internal rule ingestion requires clarification. Coordination with [X organization] may help identify existing storage locations or staging environments for automation.

Engagement Work:

Reviewed and analyzed a confidential threat report from a security vendor containing TTPs and hunting procedures.

Validated previously identified indicators of compromise based on the new intelligence.

Determined that most of the new TTP-based hunts will be applicable to an upcoming customer image, pending its availability for testing and validation.
